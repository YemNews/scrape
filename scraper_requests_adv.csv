How AI threatens to make traditional college degree 'obsolete': experts - New York Post,https://nypost.com/2023/10/05/how-ai-threatens-to-make-traditional-college-degree-obsolete/,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:46:00 GMT",New York Post,"The golden standard of the bachelor’s degree is in peril as artificial intelligence rapidly advances and employers seek workers who are well-versed in that technology.

“AI’s going to make it virtually impossible for a one-off moment of learning [like a degree] to last an entire career,” LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky said this week at the Talent Connect Summit, a conference of the country’s 2,000 top recruiters.

As smart tech progresses, jobs will be expected to evolve, placing an emphasis on people skills rather than trade tasks that can be learned by a machine.

LinkedIn executives highlighted the “critical” need for up-skilling as AI technology develops, meaning that employee adaptability will be an expectation, rendering program-oriented four-year degrees virtually useless.

As a result of technological innovation in the past decade, whole industries have turned “upside down,” Indeed CEO Chris Hyams said last month as he also warned that college-learned skills could become “obsolete.”

Not only is AI feared to overtake jobs or whole industries, but employers are also seeking workers who know how to utilize it in the workplace.

Job skills are projected to change by 65% by 2030, according to data from LinkedIn, as listings mentioning ChatGPT or similar generative AI have increased by more than 20-fold since last year.

According to the platform’s survey, 47% of US executives believed that AI could enhance productivity in the workplace, as some plan to integrate the technology into their organizations within the year.

The company’s Future of Work Report estimated the fraction of tasks that could be performed by a machine by occupation — saying 96% of a software engineer’s job could benefit or be taken over by AI, while only 6% of a nurse’s job could potentially be augmented by the software.

Despite only 4% of executives surveyed by LinkedIn planning to “reassess roles and reduce headcount” due to AI, the introduction of the generative technology prompted unease, as workers fear the job market could be choked by artificial intelligence.

In March, more than 1,000 experts co-signed a letter urging a temporary pause for the rapid development of AI, as Goldman Sachs warned that an estimated 300 million jobs could be impacted or lost due to the technology.

This year, the Writers Guild of America went on strike partially in protest of Hollywood’s plans to integrate AI — or, in other words, to create without creators.

The union, which picketed for 148 days, objected to the use of AI in the writer’s room to pen scripts, train machines or serve as source material.

Intelligent technology is the center of outcry among truckers, too, as the integration of self-driving freight trucks looms. Despite a vote in the California State Senate to prohibit driverless vehicles on major highways, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill, deeming it “unnecessary.”"
Harnessing AI to improve the health care experience: It's not as ... - Medical Economics,https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/harnessing-ai-to-improve-the-health-care-experience-it-s-not-as-fraught-as-you-think,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:18:59 GMT",Medical Economics,"© Tierney - stock.adobe.com

Despite the significant inroads U.S. health care has made in recent years, the sad truth is that physician burnout is at an all-time high. According to athenahealth’s 2022 Physician Sentiment Survey, nearly half of the clinicians surveyed in the United States are feeling burned out from their work.

Administrative burdens play a large part in the problems physicians face. Close to two-thirds said they’re overwhelmed by record-keeping requirements, and 68% said they were frustrated by their inability to spend more time with their patients. Moreover, many believe things are not improving; athenahealth’s survey found that most doctors are pessimistic about the future of health care in the United States.

Too often, technology itself has created some of these burdens and made providers’ jobs harder. But technology should and can be an enabler, rather than a barrier – when applied to the right use cases, technology can help support physicians by removing administrative burdens – allowing physicians to spend more time with their patients and reduce the stress that many feel has become a major burden in their profession.

Nele Jessel, MD

athenahealth

One promising technology in this vein is artificial intelligence (AI). Many industries currently use it to automate complex processes and improve efficiencies and outcomes. That’s certainly true in the use of AI in health care, where it is increasingly being deployed to remove repetitive administrative tasks that bog down doctors and staff, worsen the physician-patient relationship, and increasingly cause clinician and staff burnout.

AI’s potential to help reduce health care burnout

AI can help curate, decipher and contextualize the enormous and growing amount of digital data that now comprises a patient’s electronic health record (EHR). Rather than forcing the physician to wade through reams of information, AI can summarize and surface relevant data, allowing the provider to quickly assess the patient’s situation.

For example, AI can turn unstructured data into meaningful information and distill the text into more easily digestible and actionable formats for providers. This can be extremely useful in instances such as finding and extracting key information from patient charts.

Generative AI, a new powerful tool

Combining ambient voice technology with generative AI has the potential to not only mitigate documentation burden but remove the computer from the physician-patient interaction and bring the “care” back to health care. With this technology, providers can focus on the visit and interaction with the patient while the conversation is automatically captured by ambient voice. From there, generative AI can formulate a succinct visit note from the encounter in real time that can be reviewed by the provider for any necessary corrections prior to sign off.

Generative AI can also be employed to create virtual symptom checkers – chatbots – that clinicians can use to triage patients and either answer the patient’s concern or direct the individual to an urgent care or another appropriate facility, potentially mitigating some of the burden of evening on-call duty for physicians.

Generative AI powered chatbots have already proven that they can answer questions with human-like tone and are sometimes perceived to be more polite in their responses than humans. That’s because Large Language Models (LLMs) do not get tired, frustrated, or angry even after many hours of repetitive work. Of course, today’s LLMs are still prone to hallucinations – they are trained on enormous data sets and excel at combining data in a logical sounding way that is, nevertheless, incorrect. The good news is that accuracy can be increased by rooting an LLM’s answers into specific health care data, so we may be getting closer to the vision of a reliable virtual assistant. And let’s not forget that accuracy of tired, overburdened providers and medical staff decreases as well – so there is real potential here.

Harnessing AI to improve diagnosis accuracy

AI has shown significant promise in improving diagnosis accuracy and decreasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is already being deployed in this manner in radiology image interpretations, to give just one example.

Harnessing AI to improve patient follow up

Patients often feel overwhelmed during a physician visit, stressed about their symptoms, and even disoriented by the sheer number of people in the waiting room. In this type of situation, it can often be difficult to remember what a physician says about their diagnosis or follow-up instructions.

By using AI, doctors can quickly create and send personalized care plans and medication information to the patient post visit, either via text message or a follow-up voice call using artificial voice technology.

The promise of AI in health care

AI has the potential to improve patient outcomes by assisting physicians, not just with administrative tasks, but also with clinical care, lessening the underlying administrative burdens of health care that have become the unintended negative consequences of our digital age.

These current and potential uses of AI free the physician to spend more time with the patient, thereby improving the doctor-patient experience. That experience is colored not simply by the physician, but by the entire environment to which a patient is exposed: from the first interaction during the visit, to the level of calm, staff friendliness, and attentiveness.

As Dr. Eric Topol notes in his book Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again, “It is clear to me that AI will never replace physicians – but physicians who use AI will replace physicians who don’t.”

From pediatrician to chief medical officer of athenahealth, Nele Jessel, MD, is on a mission to leverage technology to restore the human touch to health care and alleviate the administrative burden for doctors."
Fitbit's new AI chatbot will tell you exactly why you workout felt like a ... - TechRadar,https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/fitness-trackers/fitbits-new-ai-chatbot-will-tell-you-exactly-why-you-workout-felt-like-a-slog,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:42:08 GMT",TechRadar,"Google teased a whole host of new tech at the recent Pixel 8 event, not least the upcoming Google Pixel 2 Watch and Fitbit Charge 6.

But it also used the platform to delve into a new line of features that it calls Fitbit Labs, which will likely appear in its app from 2024. The tech uses generative artificial intelligence to make an assessments of your workout performance based on a whole host of health and wellness metrics.

It was revealed that part of this development will see a chatbot added to the Fitbit app that will engage in a conversation to help you better understand why a particular run, swim, cycle or workout was either great, or (most likely, in our case) particularly poor.

There were hints that the technology will be able to debrief users after a session, with the AI chatbot commenting on performance and dishing out stats, such as max heart rate or average pace – and how it compares to previously logged activities.

What’s more, the technology will be able to harness a wealth of health and wellness data gathered from the user, including sleep quality, stress, recovery and the current exercise load. Drawing on this information, the AI chatbot can then look to explain how these factors may be affecting current training and even mood.

Google also revealed that it intends to dive deeper into performance metrics via visualizations within the app, such as charts and graphs. For now, trusted testers will get to try Fitbit Labs features, while it refines its AI offering and launches it to US Fitbit users in 2024.

Analysis: Is Fitbit trying to muscle in on Garmin turf?

Fitbit hasn’t exactly been earning golden stars from its fans, seeing as the recent redesign of its app has gone down like a lead balloon, but news of its AI bot suggests it is aiming to delve deeper into performance metrics – and it looks promising.

Garmin has long offered in-depth analysis of a user’s fitness prowess and since purchasing Firstbeat Analytics, which means the number of metrics it can track and analyze is streets ahead of much of the competition. In fact, only professional coaches arguably have a better handle of an athlete’s performance stats.

The announcement of Fitbit’s AI chatbot feels like it is attempting to offer a solution to Garmin’s Training Readiness and Health Snapshot Features, which essentially takes data from all of its sensors over a set period of time, including Sleep Score, training load, Heart Rate Variability and more, to predict your performance and offer suggestions on the type of workout they should undertake on a particular day.

Where Garmin offers in-depth training tools for those embarking on marathons or Iron Man events, Fitbit could use similar data to encourage wearers to keep plugging away at a more modest goal, or to try a bit harder during their next run.

But rather than (often) confusing data, this could be presented in a chatty, informal way that anyone can understand. That's the idea, at least – we're looking forward to taking it for a spin, despite our misgivings about AI chatbots dishing out fitness advice."

(Photo: Cindy Suffa/Idaho Business Review)

On the eve of Micron’s 45th anniversary, its chief executive officer, Sanjay Mehrotra, talked to a packed room at Boise State University’s Stueckle Sky Center, highlighting how far the company has come and how far it has yet to go.

On Oct. 4, Mehrotra, who has been CEO since 2017, told the crowd of a couple hundred people that Micron would be breaking ground on a 600,000-square-foot manufacturing plant the next day. The plant would be coupled with the research and development lab, creating 2,000 new jobs at the company. The talk was part of a speaker series organized by the Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce.

“That colocation benefit is going to accelerate time to market of new advanced technologies,” he said in response to a question posed by Dr. Marlene Tromp, president of Boise State, who conducted the interview. “It will accelerate our ability to bring innovation in high volume production in the best quality manner much faster than anything we have been able to do in the past.”

By building the new facility, Mehrotra pointed out, it creates jobs throughout the rest of the community in other industries. Micron estimates an additional 15,000 jobs will come out of the project.

“So, over the course of a few years, it will make a difference of 17,000 new jobs and more than that, it will actually help increase that, and these are high-paying jobs,” he said. “It will increase the average wages in the community by a substantial percentage, as well as actually improve the child poverty in the region.”

The fabrication facility is slated to begin operating by 2026, which Mehrotra called an “aggressive timeline.”

Only about 2% of memory systems are created in the United States, he pointed out, “obviously, this has to change.”

Mehrotra said that in 10 years that percentage will increase to 15. And, he added, 60% of Micron’s memory will be produced in the U.S.

Along with creating new jobs in tech, Micron is focusing on creating a new workforce in tech, partnering with various educational institutions to make STEM learning available to students as early as kindergarten to get children interested in tech careers.

“We are very much focused on traditionally hiring from four-year colleges, but (we’re) looking at more representation of two-year college for apprenticeships for technician jobs which are highly sophisticated and well-paying jobs as well,” he said. “And reaching out to underrepresented groups, tapping into talent in the rural areas and … training them for our workforce.”

Mehrotra added that having a more diverse and inclusive workforce, hiring more women engineers, various ethnicities and veterans will help provide more viewpoints will create better innovation. “I think it’s a big opportunity for really creating opportunity for all.”

“The more people you have with different approaches and different mindsets on your teams, the more you’re going to produce outcomes that are strong, better than you could produce” without that diversity, Tromp said.

Mehrotra also cited research that showed without efforts to create a workforce, the semiconductor industry could face a shortage of 75,000 workers by 2030.

As the company progresses, it looks to embrace and innovate emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI). Micron is already developing tools that could have far-reaching benefits.

“We recently introduced a product that’s called high-bandwidth memory. And that high bandwidth is really important to address generative AI applications,” Mehrotra said. “Generative AI is not about just data analytics and insights into the data, but it is also about data creation,” which will require massive amounts of memory.

Micron’s high-bandwidth memory, he said, is 50% faster and 50% more dense than other compatible products on the market.

For Mehrotra, the tech industry should help enhance the quality of life worldwide through innovations.

“With all these advances in technology tied to AI and autonomous and IOT and industrial, I really look forward to continuing to uplift all the communities in society, here and everywhere,” he said."
Intuit Mailchimp partners with Wix for exciting new online shopping ... - Atlanta Small Business Network,https://www.asbn.com/small-business/small-business-news/intuit-mailchimp-partners-with-wix-for-exciting-new-online-shopping-features/,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:25:01 GMT",Atlanta Small Business Network,"Intuit Mailchimp, the #1 email marketing and automation brand, announces a new strategic partnership with Wix.com, a leading global SaaS platform to create, manage, and grow an online presence, as well as integration with Buy with Prime, enhanced generative AI, and SMS features, giving marketers more tools and information than ever to target better, personalize, and automate their marketing during the holiday shopping season. Intuit is a multinational financial technology platform that produces products such as TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp.

Mailchimp’s annual Marketing Success Season, a three-day virtual conference, was created to give marketers the tools, knowledge, and inspiration they need to develop and implement effective marketing plans this holiday season.

Key takeaways from the conference:

Two-thirds of marketers believe the holiday season accounts for between 21% and 40% of their company’s annual sales. For example, throughout the Black Friday weekend in 2022, Mailchimp users sent over 8 billion emails.

Customers are 87% more likely to click into a personalized email and 71% more likely to purchase a business that sends them a customized email.

A third of marketers say they feel overwhelmed by the variety of personalization capabilities available, and a similar number say they lack the time to examine all of them thoroughly.

On the other hand, users with Wix accounts can seamlessly sync and organize their customer data with a Mailchimp and Wix collaboration. The partnership will assist Wix marketers in customizing their campaigns based on Mailchimp’s real-time behavioral data to increase engagement and employ AI-powered capabilities that automate and provide performance recommendations for strategy optimization.

Sony AI proposes new solution to address computer vision bias ... - ReadWrite,https://readwrite.com/sony-ai-proposes-new-solution-to-address-computer-vision-bias-against-yellow-skin/,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:22:16 GMT",ReadWrite,"Japanese technology behemoth Sony described a possible way to measure system bias against some skin tones in a recent paper.

Computer vision systems have historically struggled with accurately detecting and analyzing individuals with yellow undertones in their skin color. The standard Fitzpatrick skin type scale does not adequately account for variation in skin hue, focusing only on tone from light to dark. As a result, standard datasets and algorithms exhibit reduced performance on people with yellow skin colors.

This issue disproportionately impacts certain ethnic groups, like Asians, leading to unfair outcomes. For example, studies have shown facial recognition systems produced in the West have lower accuracy for Asian faces compared to other ethnicities. The lack of diversity in training data is a key factor driving these biases.

In the paper, Sony AI researchers proposed a multidimensional approach to measuring apparent skin color in images to better assess fairness in computer vision systems. The study argues that the common approach of using the Fitzpatrick skin type scale to characterize skin color is limited, as it only focuses on skin tone from light to dark. Instead, the researchers put forward measuring both the perceptual lightness L*, to capture skin tone and the hue angle h*, to capture skin hue ranging from red to yellow. The study’s lead author, William Thong, explained:

“While practical and effective, reducing the skin color to its tone is limiting given the skin constitutive complexity. […] We therefore promote a multidimensional scale to better represent apparent skin color variations among individuals in images.”

The researchers demonstrated the value of this multidimensional approach in several experiments. First, they showed that standard face images datasets like CelebAMask-HQ and FFHQ are skewed toward light-red skin color and under-represent dark-yellow skin colors. Generative models trained on these datasets reproduce a similar bias.

Second, the study revealed skin tone and hue biases in saliency-based image cropping and face verification models. Twitter’s image cropping algorithm showed a preference for light-red skin colors. Popular face verification models also performed better on light and red skin colors.

Finally, manipulating skin tone and hue revealed causal effects in attribute prediction models. People with lighter skin tones were more likely to be classified as feminine, while those with redder skin hues were more frequently predicted as smiling. Thong concluded:

“Our contributions to assessing skin color in a multidimensional manner offer novel insights, previously invisible, to better understand biases in the fairness assessment of both datasets and models.”

The researchers recommend adopting multidimensional skin color scales as a fairness tool when collecting new datasets or evaluating computer vision models. This could help mitigate issues like under-representation and performance differences for specific skin colors.

Education Secretary addresses the Confederation of School Trusts - GOV.UK,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/education-secretary-addresses-the-confederation-of-school-trusts,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:24:21 GMT",GOV.UK,"To start, I want to say thank you. For your leadership, your resilience, your incredible work.

I really mean this because I do see your work as incredible and achievements as outstanding. It has been difficult, especially as we continue to recover from the pandemic, nobody in this room thinks it’s anything but, and most recently as we have grappled with the RAAC (reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete) issue.

I want to put on record my thank you to Baroness Barran for her brilliant leadership on RAAC. She’s done a really amazing job.

I’m here today with a simple message. I promise that I will do everything I can to support all of you. I see that as my job; to minimise the disruption our kids face, and to keep them in the classroom and get a great education.

But there is another reason it’s really great to be here today and that is because I look at the theme on your banner today we’ve spoken about it, about ‘belonging’, and how important that is.

It’s not often that conference themes really hit the mark but for me, this one does.

Because I can bet that at one moment, every one of us has felt that we don’t belong.

I’ve felt it in the world of business where I spent 30 years. It is hardly dominated by people who started on the factory floor.

That can be hard enough for an adult but when you’re young, if you don’t feel like you belong, everything becomes that bit harder.

It’s thanks to you, your staff, your teachers, that kids feel not just that they are there to learn, but that schools are happy places, safe places, places for them to explore, to grow and places for them to flourish. That is the environment you create day in and day out.

Belonging is not only fundamental within schools. Our entire education system needs to prepare young people to find their place and thrive in a complex and ever-changing world.

A child starting school today at the age of five will join a labour market that will be unrecognisable to us.

Their jobs will be shaped by artificial intelligence and quantum. They will need to have the skills to deliver the net zero transition that we have legislated for. They could be part of profound advances in life sciences or leading the way with advanced forms of manufacturing.

Around the world, students need their options open, not narrowed. We must harness everything we know that drives high quality education for every young person up to the age of 18 and beyond.

There is strength, not just in depth, but also in breadth.

This means strengthening teaching and achievement in maths and English as well as science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects. It means offering breadth as well as rigour. It means achieving genuine parity between the academic and technical routes.

That is why we have announced that we will introduce a new Advanced British Standard (ABS) for 16–19-year-olds. I’m sure you’ve got many questions around that and we can work together to answer those questions.

This is the next chapter in our reforms.

It builds on a journey that we started together. Between 2005 and 2010, Michael Gove and Nick Gibb did a lot of work to prepare for what we thought was going to make a massive different to our children’s education.

You have all been instrumental in making huge strides over the last decade to drive up standards in our schools.

88% of schools are now Good or Outstanding. Our 9 and 10 year olds are the best in the west at reading. You did that, our children did that.

You have worked with us as we have introduced rigour and new standards to post 16 education in this country. We worked together to update and overhaul A Levels, introduce T Levels and build a world class apprenticeship system which you’ll know is very dear to my heart.

But still we know that between 16 and 19 our young people study fewer subjects compared to their peers in other countries. And they have far fewer contact hours in which they can learn from the experts – their teachers. And still too many young people leave at 18 without the critical maths and English they need.

We need to build on those reforms and we need to go further. Because the world is changing faster than we’ve ever known. We have to lift our sights. We have to be bold and even more ambitious about what our young people need, what will help them succeed.

The new Advanced British Standard will expand the range of what our 16 to 19 year olds learn, increase the amount of time they spend with their teachers and finally end the artificial divide between academic and technical education – crucially, we will build on the strong foundations of A Levels, and on the high quality, employer-led occupational standards, underpinning T Levels.

I am under no illusion about the scale of these changes. They are profound and they are long-term. I’ve only come here to do difficult things because difficult things make a difference.

They will take time and care to implement well. We will need to work together to develop our plans with schools, colleges, further education providers, unions, employers and the high education sector. With all of you.

But there are some things we need to start straight away to lay the groundwork for this plan. So we have announced that we are investing over £600 million, over the next 2 years, to improve the recruitment and retention of teachers of key shortage subjects in schools and colleges, strengthen support to those pupils who need to resit GCSE maths or English, and spread teaching excellence.

To improve the recruitment and retention of teachers in key shortage subjects, this package includes investing around £100 million each year to double the rates of the Levelling Up Premium and expand this to include FE (further education) colleges. All teachers who are in the first five years of their career, teaching shortage subjects and working in disadvantaged schools, will be paid up to £6,000 per year tax-free.

This package also includes £60 million over two years to improve maths education, including through expanding teaching for mastery approaches across the country, using our maths hubs and increasing access to core maths. All of which revolutionised maths and the teaching of maths.

In developing this plan we will continue to build-upon the knowledge rich focus of our reforms so far. Because we know a knowledge rich curriculum is what builds understanding and unlocks the skills needed for problem solving, reasoning and critical thinking.

We will continue to be evidence led. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), which was established in 2011 and didn’t exist before, sets the standard now across the world on better use of evidence to improve education. From them, we know what works to improve teaching and learning. That is why our funding package includes an additional £40m million for the EEF so they can create and share high quality evidence of what works at 16 to 19, particularly what works to close the gap for disadvantaged pupils at that age.

Thanks to you and your trusts we have a tried and tested model of improvement for our schools. You have led the way in changing the landscape of the school system over the last decade – sometimes let’s be honest in the face of resistance.

We were talking in the cabinet about new ABS and at that point we were reminded of the resistance that Michael Gove and Nick Gibb faced trying to reform our school standards and school system. It’s never easy. Change that is truly worth it is never easy but the results are worth it. But we are really confident having seen the results that you have delivered over the past decade and more that I can ask you once again to work with us to turn that same focus to our 16 to 19 year olds.

I have heard those who say that now is not the time for long term ambitious reform. That we have plenty of challenges in the system today. Change is already here. We sometimes don’t get to set the agenda because it’s being shaped by everything around us and technological advances is definitely one of those.

If we want an education system in 10, 20, 30 years’ time that ensures all young people leave education better prepared to find their place in the world then we can’t afford to wait.

A functioning society and a growing economy relies on an education system that delivers for everyone. Even today in our country we have a massive skills gap that is slowing down our growth which is a lot faster than anyone predicted. But still it would be even faster if we had the skills and talent that we need.

I agree we must work relentlessly on today’s challenges in our schools, which we will continue to respond to. But it would be wrong to ignore the future. These reforms will help pave the way. We always have to deal with the now while looking towards the future.

The pandemic cast a long shadow. It changed everything. You worked tirelessly to support schools, teachers, pupils and parents throughout.

I know we have not yet recovered. I look at the data all the time, I go into schools all the time.

Particularly for the most disadvantaged kids. You made so much progress closing the disadvantage gap between 2011 and 2019 it narrowed by an outstanding 9% at secondary and by 13% at primary school. But it’s true the pandemic set us back and we need to rebuild.

I believe in life that you don’t write anyone off. It’s a personal belief, and in this case it means one thing which is reducing the disadvantage gap. It is the only option.

The kids who are struggling don’t have any less potential.

As I hope I have demonstrated already, I will continue to argue the case for what schools need. I do understand. That’s one of the benefits of having a Knowsley comprehensive school education myself.

I know that funding won’t fix everything, but I’ve made sure that from next year overall school funding will be more than £59.6 billion, the highest per-pupil figure in real terms ever.

But that will only take us so far.

It’s people who make belonging happen. Its people who make sure all children get the opportunities to succeed. And only with people, including every single person in this room, can we solve the challenges we face.

Take one that we always talk about – workload. It’s a word, but what it really means is teachers feeling tired, unsupported, overworked. Doing tasks which they don’t feel are even that useful.

We need to support teachers. They are our most vital assets. It’s not the buildings and it’s not even all the other things that we provide. It is teachers. They want to focus on what they do best which is teaching, changing lives.

I was at a school in the Wirral yesterday and there were five of us in a room and we were all in our 40s and 50s and I said I strongly believe every single person in our whole country can talk about a teacher who changed their lives. We went around the room and every single one came up with one immediately, not even with a seconds hesitation. 40 or 50 years later.

Mine is a teacher called Mr Ashcroft who stayed behind after hours in my comprehensive school so he could teach me technical drawing and engineering – unbelievably it was a subject that only boys were allowed to study.

So I really believe in teachers. I really believe that what they do with most of their time is change lives. Our Workload Reduction Taskforce which met for the first-time last month will get results. We’ve done it before.

This isn’t one of those things where we kick the can down the road. They will report their interim findings to me shortly, and we’ve set a deadline of spring so that we can work out what is needed to further reduce working hours by 5 hours per week.

I’ve asked for proper solutions. We did it before the pandemic, we can do it again now. Absolutely reason why not.

Because no other profession is as important in shaping the lives of the next generation. In shaping the future.

I pay tribute to every single teacher, and I mean every word I say – but I also know – thank you isn’t enough.

We need to ensure teachers feel valued and supported when they join, and to stay in the profession. Indeed, we will need even more teachers in order to meet our longer-term ambitions for the Advanced British Standard.

We are offering new teacher starting salaries of at least £30,000. But we must and we will go further. The world has changed following the pandemic.

Flexible working is an example. You can love it or hate it, there’s a great debate on the pros and cons, but you can’t deny that expectations are changing.

Some of you are already adapting. You tell me that expanding and promoting flexible working opportunities for staff can help you get the right people and keep them.

To support this, we are funding a programme to embed flexible working in more schools.

But there is more we can do. Mental health is another area.

I know the value that you in this room, and so many school and trust leaders across the country place on having a whole school approach to mental health and wellbeing.

You are already making a difference. Nearly 3,000 schools and colleges have already signed up to our wellbeing charter.

You’ve told us that technology could have a potentially transformative effect on reducing workload and help on wellbeing and mental health. I hope to be able to say more shortly on how we will explore the potential impact of generative artificial intelligence on education, including reducing time spent by teachers on administrative tasks.

We will bring all of this together by updating our teacher recruitment and retention strategy. I want to make sure this reflects the real context you face.

I’ve not come into this job to write bits of paper that don’t make a difference to you. I want to make sure we can continue to recruit and retain the best teachers.

But great teaching doesn’t matter unless the kids are in the classroom.

People make a community, and children make a school.

It’s so important that every child attends school every day. That they’re supported to feel that they belong.

Too many children are missing school regularly, or are persistently absent. More children are missing school more often than before the pandemic.

As I have said before, solving this is one of my top priorities. Because nothing would be worse than giving up on those children.

I know that the challenge has grown since the pandemic and made your jobs more challenging. Thank you for the hard work you are doing to tackle the absence problem. It is slowly starting to make a difference but we know the size of the challenge.

Only you will know how to best deal with the individual issues each child will face. But I am here to help you.

Leora, through her membership of our attendance action alliance, rightly challenges me on what you need to support you.

Attendance needs to be everyone’s business. So we have set out new stronger expectations to work together to improve attendance and a support-first approach.

We’ve also expanded our attendance hub programme. We have launched 14 hubs, supporting around 800 schools, and launched our attendance mentors pilot in Middlesbrough, Stoke, my home borough of Knowsley, Salford and Doncaster.

We have to get this right. I believe that by working together and supporting families, we will build that sense of belonging and get children into school with the support and stability they deserve. But we do know it’s more challenging, we do know children have lost their confidence, they are more anxious and they need help to take that step back into school, to feel they belong.

I truly believe that ability is spread evenly, but opportunity is not.

I know that because I’ve lived it, it’s in my DNA. If you sat next to kids in a Knowsley comprehensive school every day and you see the outcomes of their lives 40 years later, you know that is true.

That’s why a high-quality curriculum matters, because we just can’t just let ourselves have the soft leadership of low expectations for those children.

That’s what we had. We were not deemed to have as much potential because of postcode. We had that in the past, we had that when I was at school. It will not happen on my watch, on Nick Gibbs’s watch or Diana Barran’s watch.

It’s why sports and activities matter, because they offer an opportunity to get involved, to feel like you’re part of something bigger and find something you’re good at.

These are the things that boost confidence, improve mental health, and grow friendships. They’re the things that mean you live a healthier and happier life in the future.

It’s about making sure kids, including kids with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), get the support they need. There’s a lot of children now with children who have an additional need. I’m pleased that next year, high needs funding will rise to £10.5 billion. That’s 60% more than it was just five years ago.

But it’s not just about funding – it’s also about how we use it to provide support in the right place at the right time.

Tailoring our support matters, and it helps kids with special education needs and disabilities to access full-time education. That’s their right, and it’s what ensures they can fulfil their potential.

Through our SEND change programme we’re testing our improvement plan reforms. This includes supporting mainstream schools to meet the needs of an increasing number of pupils.

But we know we can go even further to create a sense of belonging for pupils with SEND. The professional community, the CST, has established on SEND and inclusion, alongside the five principles of inclusion are a fantastic place to start.

For some pupils, timely access to local special schools will be the right approach. That is why we are building 7 new special free schools alongside 83 already committed to opening so that so that every child’s needs are met.

These are some of the challenges I am focused on today.

But I see opportunities too. I recently visited Exeter University to open their new Centre of Degree Partnerships. A few years ago I opened one at Warwick University.

Degree apprenticeships can be transformative. I know, I did one. And it is excellent to see such a prestigious university showing such a strong commitment to apprenticeships by making it a strategic priority. Because working with employers is strategic. It will strengthen research, it will strengthen those bonds and improve the academic offer.

Some may say it is unrealistic to reach into these new spaces when the day job is so full on. But I know that together we can face down the challenges we have today and build towards an ever stronger education system for our children in the future.

We must do this. We must ensure our children can compete globally with the best education we can provide by providing them with the best opportunities. There is no other option.

I will back you, and I will make sure that you and your staff have what you need to succeed.

If the prize is a country where every child feels that they belong, they can build their confidence and be the very best they can be and they will succeed, then the challenge must be worth it.

Thank you very much for all the work you’re doing. Let’s keep on going, together."
Seattle Recruiting Software Startup SeekOut Implements Workforce ... - Clayton County Register,https://www.claytoncountyregister.com/news2/seekout-lays-off-7-of-staff-in-restructuring-but-plans-to-grow-headcount-this-year/539529/,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:18:42 GMT",Clayton County Register,"Seattle-based recruiting software startup, SeekOut, has announced a workforce restructuring that resulted in the layoff of 16 employees, representing about 7% of its workforce. This move comes as the company aims to align its resources with its growth investment areas. Currently, SeekOut has approximately 200 employees, but it plans to hire more individuals and reach a total of 225 employees by the end of the year.

Despite the recent layoffs, SeekOut remains committed to its growth trajectory. The company raised $115 million in funding last year, propelling its valuation to over $1.2 billion, making it one of Seattle’s “unicorn” startups. SeekOut’s success has attracted attention from investors such as Tiger Global Management, Madrona Venture Group, and Mayfield, resulting in a total funding of $189 million to date.

SeekOut offers recruiting software utilized by over 1,000 companies, including prominent names like Salesforce and McKinsey & Co. Their software collects data on more than 700 million potential candidates from various sources, such as GitHub and published papers. SeekOut’s platform also includes built-in diversity filters to facilitate diverse and inclusive hiring practices.

Earlier this year, SeekOut expanded its product offerings with the launch of SeekOut Assist, a generative AI tool based on OpenAI’s ChatGPT. SeekOut Assist is designed to accelerate the process of finding qualified candidates, allowing recruiters to work more efficiently. This product launch further solidified SeekOut’s position as an innovative player in the recruiting software market.

While SeekOut remains optimistic about its future growth, it mirrors other Seattle-area unicorns that have had to reduce headcount due to the broader technology industry slowdown. Companies like Rad Power Bikes, Highspot, Karat, Convoy, and Flexe have been forced to make similar adjustments over the past year.

SeekOut’s CEO, Anoop Gupta, a former technical assistant to Bill Gates and former leader of Microsoft’s Unified Communications Group, has played a pivotal role in the company’s success. Gupta, together with co-founders Aravind Bala, Vikas Manocha, and John Tippett, who all have extensive experience at Microsoft, have positioned SeekOut as a competitive player in the recruiting software market.
